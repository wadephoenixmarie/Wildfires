<h1>Who to Contact?</h1>

<p>Wildfires can be pretty scary when you're in one.  You might be wondering how to stay safe.  
Unfortunately, wildfires are very dangerous and can destroy everything.  You don't want to die though.  
There are some people you can call who can help you get out of the wildfire.  The best number to call is 911.  
If you have any relatives or family close by, you can call them to help you.  
Getting ahold of anyone who will help you get out of the path of the wildfire will be great.  Anyone can help.  
If you are stuck in a wildfire, put a rag over your mouth and cover yourself with water.  
Bring a bucket of water with you.  If there is a stream nearby, follow it.  
The water will help protect you from the fire so you won't get burned.  
To stay safe, read the "How to Stay Safe" tab.  
Hopefully these people can help you get out of a wildfire when you are in one.</p>
