<h1>How to Prevent Wildfires in Colorado</h1>
<P>There are many ways we can prevent wildfires.  Some ways are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Don't light a fire in dry areas.</li>
<li>Light a fire in a camping pit, or you can make one.</li>
<li>Wildfires can start from lightning, lit cigarette butts, and more. </li>
<li>If you are camping, do not light anything on fire unless it is in a campfire pit.
</li>
<li>If you smoke, it is best to move away from trees as much as possible.
</li>
<li>When you are camping, make sure to put your fire all the way out.
</ul>
<p>This deadly disaster can be prevented from these steps above.  Colorado is a really dry state, so it causes more wildfires.  You can't start a campfire in really dry areas, or it might start a wildfire.  If you want to start a campfire, these things below will improve the amount of water in the grass.
<ul>
<li>Water dry areas twice a weak.</li>
<li>Before you start a campfire, it is best to water the vegetation around it.</li>
<li>Keep a bucket of water nearby.</li>
<li>Clear all of the vegetation from the campfire before you leave the campsite.</li>
</ul>
